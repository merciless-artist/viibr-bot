"""Counting game.

Members count upward in a designated channel, one number per message. Correct
counts get a lightning-bolt reaction. The same member cannot count twice in a
row. Non-numeric messages are ignored, so normal chat is allowed.

Modes:
- hard: a wrong number resets the count to zero.
- easy: a wrong number is marked with an X but the count stands.

Milestones (100, 200, 500, 1000, then every 1000) get a celebration message;
admins can attach one or more images/gifs to a specific number, and the bot
rotates through them at random so a repeat milestone always feels fresh.

Every correct count and every miss also feeds a per-member leaderboard,
visible to everyone with /countboard. A miscount offers a one-shot "Double or
Nothing" gamble, and every reset drops a random stat or trivia line.
